This error occurs when you try to access a property of a state variable before it has been fully initialized.  This commonly happens when a component mounts and tries to use state before the `useState` hook has had a chance to set the initial value.

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing count before it's initialized
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState();
  return (
    <Text>Count: {count * 2}</Text> //Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '2')
  );
}
```
